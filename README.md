AI Vocal Model - Sidhu Moosewala Edition


Welcome to AI Vocal Model - Sidhu Moosewala Edition, a deep learning model for analyzing and improving vocal performance, specifically based on the singing style of the late artist Sidhu Moosewala. Our data model has been trained using months of research and data collection, including every song and interview of the late artist. We have removed all the noise and instrumental from the data and used so-vits-fork to train the AI model.

This data model is a tribute to Sidhu Moosewala and has been created with utmost respect to his legacy. It is designed to help users analyze their vocal performances and provide feedback on pitch, tone, and other key aspects of singing based on Sidhu Moosewala's singing style.

With AI Vocal Model - Sidhu Moosewala Edition, you can use the included config file to fine-tune the model to your specific needs. The config file provides parameters for input data, model architecture, and training settings, allowing you to customize the model based on your preferences and requirements.

Please note that this data model is intended for educational and research purposes only. We hope that you will use it with respect and appreciate the legacy of Sidhu Moosewala.
